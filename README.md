Just make Windows more usable

My Windows Compatibility Telemetry raises the cpu usage to 100%, so i needed to deactivate it (from time to time)
This script opens the command line version of the "TASK SCHEDULER" of Windows (available via taskschd.msc in cmd or WIN+R) and follows the path 
"Microsoft\Windows\Application Experience\Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser" to deactivate it.
